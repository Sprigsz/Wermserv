# HTTP Server in C

An HTTP server implementation written in C with the purpose of learning the C language as well as network programming.

## About

This project is my exploration of low-level network programming and the HTTP protocol. Coming from a background in C++ and C#, I'm building this server from scratch to understand:

- Socket programming and TCP connections
- HTTP request/response lifecycle
- Manual memory management in C
- Systems programming concepts

## Current Status

This project is currently in the very early stages and will likely take some time to complete. I currently do not have much experience with C.
